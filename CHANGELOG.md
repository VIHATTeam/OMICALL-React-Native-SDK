# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 4.2.3 [29/07/2026]

### Upgrade — native SDK

- **[UPGRADE] iOS `OmiKit 1.11.26 → 1.11.29`.**
- **[UPGRADE] Android `omi-sdk 2.7.4 → 2.7.7`.**

## 4.2.2 [20/07/2026]

### Upgrade — native SDK

- **[UPGRADE] iOS `OmiKit 1.11.25 → 1.11.26`.**

### Fix — Expo iOS: OmiKit env/CallKit/PushKit never initialized on apps with many pods (calls fail with staging host)

**Files:** `ios/Library/OmikitPlugin.swift`, `ios/OmikitExpoAppDelegateBridge.m`

- **[FIX] Outbound calls fail on Expo iOS** with `START_CALL_FAIL` because the SDK talked to the staging host (`call-event-v2-stg.omicrm.com`) and timed out. Root cause: the Expo AppDelegate bridge registered its subscriber in Objective-C `+load`, which **races** with Expo's `didFinishLaunching` subscriber dispatch. On apps with many pods the subscriber registered too late, so `didFinishLaunching` never fired, `OmiClient.setEnviroment` / on-premise / CallKit / PushKit were never run, and OmiKit fell back to its default (staging) environment. Our example app happened to win the race, so the bug only reproduced on customer apps.
  - **Init moved to `OmikitPlugin.init()`** (the RN module), which runs deterministically when the RN bridge sets up — independent of dylib load order. It reads env / on-premise / callKitImage from Info.plist, calls `setOnPremiseInfo` → `setEnviroment`, and creates CallKit + PushKit. Idempotent (guarded) and Expo-only (`NSClassFromString("EXExpoAppDelegate")`), so bare RN CLI still inits in its own AppDelegate and is unaffected.
  - The bridge is kept only to forward remote-notification / missed-call-tap callbacks; it also sets `UNUserNotificationCenter.delegate` in `+load` (deterministic) and, if `didFinishLaunching` does reach it, re-triggers the idempotent bootstrap.
  - New log line `[OMI NATIVE] OmikitPlugin.init — bootstrap OmiKit (env=…)` confirms init ran (prints on every app, regardless of pod count).

### Docs — iOS + @react-native-firebase: use dynamic frameworks

**Files:** `README.md`

- **[DOCS] Firebase on iOS** — documented that apps combining omikit-plugin with `@react-native-firebase` should set `["expo-build-properties", { "ios": { "useFrameworks": "dynamic" } }]` (not `"static"`). Firebase v21 works with dynamic frameworks and OmiKit ships as a dynamic xcframework, so `dynamic` avoids the `GoogleUtilities does not define modules` and `Redefinition of module 'ReactCommon'` build errors that `"static"` triggers on New Architecture. Also declare `ios.googleServicesFile`.

### Backward compatibility

- React Native CLI (bare) is **not affected**: the OmiKit init change is Expo-only (guarded by `NSClassFromString("EXExpoAppDelegate")`), so bare RN CLI still inits in its own AppDelegate exactly as before. Verified: bare `example/` builds and runs unchanged.

## 4.2.0 [14/07/2026]

### Feature — Expo support (config plugin + native lifecycle hooks)

**Files:** `app.plugin.js`, `plugin/**`, `expo-module.config.json`, `ios/OmikitExpoAppDelegateBridge.m`, `android/src/expo/**`, `android/build.gradle`, `omikit-plugin.podspec`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `expo-example/**`

`omikit-plugin` now integrates on **Expo** (prebuild / dev-client / EAS Build) with **zero manual native edits** — just install the package and add the plugin to `app.json` `plugins`. React Native CLI (bare) keeps working exactly as before, unchanged. **Verified end-to-end (outbound + inbound calls) on real iOS (iPhone) and Android devices.**

- **[UPGRADE] Native SDK**: iOS `OmiKit 1.11.23 → 1.11.25`, Android `omi-sdk 2.7.0 → 2.7.4`.

- **[FEATURE] Expo config plugin** — automates all native setup during prebuild:
  - **iOS** (`withInfoPlist`): `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription` (only when `enableVideo`), `UIBackgroundModes` (`voip`, `remote-notification`, `fetch`), and config keys for the bridge to read. (`withEntitlementsPlist`): `aps-environment` (Push Notifications capability).
  - **Android** (`withAndroidManifest`): permissions (INTERNET, RECORD_AUDIO, POST_NOTIFICATIONS, FOREGROUND_SERVICE(+PHONE_CALL/MICROPHONE), SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW, USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT, CAMERA for video), removes FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA when audio-only, MainActivity attrs (`showWhenLocked`/`turnScreenOn`/`launchMode=singleTask`), incoming-call intent-filter, config meta-data. (`withProjectBuildGradle`): adds maven `jitpack.io` + **GitHub Packages** `maven.pkg.github.com/omicall/OMICall-SDK` with credentials read from `OMI_USER`/`OMI_TOKEN` (env var or gradle property — the token is never hardcoded).

- **[FEATURE] Plugin props** (`app.json`): `environment`, `enableVideo`, `userNameKey`, `maxCall`, `callKitImage`, `typePushVoip`, `microphonePermission`, `cameraPermission`, `apsEnvironment`, and `onPremise` (11 optional host/SIP/TURN fields). Defaults match the existing RN CLI setup.

- **[FEATURE] Native lifecycle hooks** — OmiKit runtime init runs automatically instead of injecting code into AppDelegate/MainActivity:
  - **iOS** `OmikitExpoAppDelegateBridge.m` (pure Objective-C, inside the pod): registers itself as an Expo AppDelegate subscriber at `+load` (via `EXExpoAppDelegate registerSubscriber:`, called entirely through the ObjC runtime `NSClassFromString`/`performSelector` so it needs no ExpoModulesCore header). Runs `setOnPremiseInfo` → `setEnviroment` → CallKit/PushKit setup, forwards `didRegisterForRemoteNotifications` (→ `setUserPushNotificationToken`), `didReceiveNotificationResponse` (→ `OmikitNotification.didRecieve`), `applicationWillTerminate` (→ `OMICloseCall`). Reads its config from Info.plist keys.
    - **Written in ObjC (not Swift)** so `+load` is reliably force-loaded from the static lib via the `-ObjC` linker flag — a Swift `@objc` class with only a `+load` gets dead-stripped from the binary. Guarded by `#if __has_include(<OmiKit/OmiKit.h>)`; on bare RN CLI (no Expo) `+load` finds `EXExpoAppDelegate` absent and no-ops.
  - **Android** `OmikitReactActivityLifecycleListener` + `OmikitExpoPackage` (source set `android/src/expo`, compiled only when `expo-modules-core` is present, `compileOnly`): wires `onResume`, `onNewIntent` → `handlePickupIntentEarly` + `onGetIntentFromNotification`. Expo autolinking discovers it via `expo-module.config.json` and registers it automatically (no runtime hack needed as on iOS).

- **[FIX] Removed podspec `EXCLUDED_ARCHS[simulator]=arm64`** — OmiKit ≥ 1.11.23 ships an `ios-arm64-simulator` slice. The exclusion previously forced x86_64/Rosetta builds on Apple Silicon and dropped `.o` files (including the bridge's `+load`) from the simulator binary. Also benefits RN CLI (native arm64 simulator builds, faster).

### Backward compatibility (RN CLI is NOT affected)

- 100% additive. The config plugin only runs when `app.json` lists `omikit-plugin` under `plugins` (Expo). Bare RN CLI never invokes it.
- The iOS bridge is guarded by `#if __has_include(<OmiKit/OmiKit.h>)` and its `+load` no-ops when Expo is absent. The Android source set is conditional (`compileOnly expo-modules-core`). Non-Expo builds compile normally.
- No changes to `src/`, the core podspec (only OmiKit version bump + EXCLUDED_ARCHS removal), or the `react-native (>=0.74.0)` peer dependency. `expo` is an optional peer dependency; `dependencies` is empty and `@expo/config-plugins` lives in devDependencies, so RN CLI consumers pull no extra deps.

### Notes

- **Android FCM**: required to receive inbound calls. Add `@react-native-firebase/app` + `/messaging` and declare `android.googleServicesFile` in `app.json` (see `expo-example`). iOS uses PushKit (handled by the bridge — no Firebase needed).
- **Android omi-sdk** is on GitHub Packages (private) — needs `OMI_TOKEN`. Set `OMI_USER`/`OMI_TOKEN` in the environment when building, or in `android/gradle.properties` (gitignored).
- **Kotlin version**: set `kotlinVersion` via `expo-build-properties` to match your React Native version (RN 0.76 → `1.9.24`) to avoid a Compose-compiler mismatch.
- On-premise `turnPassword` passed through `app.json` props is committed to git — prefer env / `app.config.js` or EAS secrets for production.
- Video on New Architecture requires bridge mode (not bridgeless).

### Dev tooling

- `plugin/` builds separately via `tsc` (not bob); `prepack` = `bob build && tsc --build plugin`.
- Snapshot tests: `yarn test:plugin` (20 tests — iOS Info.plist/entitlements, Android manifest/gradle, integration).
- `build.sh` verifies both the RN CLI and Expo example builds before tagging + publishing.

## 4.1.8 [08/06/2026]

### Feature — On-Premise Endpoint Configuration (iOS 1.11.23 / Android 2.7.0)

Enterprise customers can now route SDK traffic to their own on-premise infrastructure (HTTP backends, SIP proxy, STUN, TURN) without forking the SDK.

**This is a native-only API.** The plugin does NOT wrap this in a JavaScript bridge method, because the JS bridge cannot run before the SDK's first HTTP / SIP call. Calling from JS would race the SDK's internal init (FCM token registration, SIP register, push setup) and ANY native call that fires before JS bundle is ready would hit the default OMI cloud endpoints. The config must be set in `AppDelegate` (iOS) / `MainApplication` (Android) so it persists in native storage before any SDK code runs.

### Where to call

**iOS — `AppDelegate.m`** (BEFORE `[super application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:]` and before any RN setup):

```objc
#import <OmiKit/OmiKit.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  [OmiClient setOnPremiseInfoWithMobileSdkHost:@"omisdk.your-domain.com"
                                callEventHost:@"call-event.your-domain.com"
                                publicApiHost:@"public.your-domain.com"
                                 pushInfoHost:@"push-info.your-domain.com"
                                  app2AppHost:@"app-2-app.your-domain.com"
                                logUploadHost:@"log-upload.your-domain.com"
                                     sipProxy:@"sig.your-domain.com:5222"
                                   stunServer:@"stun.your-domain.com:3478"
                                   turnServer:@"turn.your-domain.com:2222"
                                 turnUsername:@"your-turn-user"
                                 turnPassword:@"your-turn-pass"];

  // ... existing RN bootstrap
}
```

**Android — `MainApplication.kt`** (in `onCreate`, BEFORE `SoLoader.init` / RN init):

```kotlin
import vn.vihat.omicall.omisdk.OmiClient

class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    OmiClient.setOnPremiseInfo(
      this,
      mobileSdkHost = "omisdk.your-domain.com",
      callEventHost = "call-event.your-domain.com",
      publicApiHost = "public.your-domain.com",
      pushInfoHost  = "push-info.your-domain.com",
      app2AppHost   = "app-2-app.your-domain.com",
      logUploadHost = "log-upload.your-domain.com",
      sipProxy      = "sig.your-domain.com:5222",
      stunServer    = "stun.your-domain.com:3478",
      turnServer    = "turn.your-domain.com:2222",
      turnUsername  = "your-turn-user",
      turnPassword  = "your-turn-pass",
    )

    SoLoader.init(this, false)
    // ... existing RN bootstrap
  }
}
```

To revert: `[OmiClient clearOnPremiseInfo]` (iOS) / `OmiClient.clearOnPremiseInfo(this)` (Android).

### Behavior

- **Persistence**: Config saved natively (iOS `NSUserDefaults` key `omicall/onpremise_config_v1`, Android `SharedPreferences` `omicall_onpremise`/`config_v1`) so it survives app relaunch. After first install, subsequent launches read the saved config directly — no race.
- **HTTP**: replaces scheme + host only; path + query preserved 100%.
- **Priority**:
  - HTTP: **on-premise > SDK hardcoded default**
  - SIP / Media: **on-premise > dynamic API provider > SDK hardcoded default**
- **DNS (Android)**: When on-premise active, the SDK bypasses custom public DNS (`8.8.8.8` / `1.1.1.1`) and uses **system DNS** so internal hostnames resolve over the customer's private network / VPN. Applies to BOTH OkHttp HTTP layer and PJSIP native.
- **Empty / null fields**: treated as "keep SDK default" — set only the fields the customer overrides.

### Why no JS API

A `setOnPremiseInfo()` JavaScript wrapper was considered and rejected for these reasons:

1. **First-launch race**: JS bundle load takes hundreds of ms. The native SDK can fire HTTP requests (FCM registration, push setup) before JS evaluates → those requests would hit the default cloud endpoints.
2. **VoIP push entry**: On iOS, VoIP push arrives at `PKPushRegistry` → native SDK code path, which never touches JS. Config must be in native storage by then.
3. **Re-init churn**: Setting config from JS every app launch is wasteful (write to NSUserDefaults / SharedPreferences each cold start) and visually confusing — the native API is `set once on first install, persists forever` semantics.

If client apps need to switch tenants at runtime, they should call the native API + restart the SDK process (`logoutAndWait` → `startServices`) — but this is rarely needed in practice.

### Backward compatibility

100% backward compatible. Apps that do NOT call `setOnPremiseInfo` see byte-for-byte identical behavior to previous versions — same default cloud endpoints, same SIP proxy, same STUN / TURN.

### Dependencies

- Upgrade OmiKit iOS SDK: `1.11.19` → `1.11.23` (also includes 1.11.20–1.11.22: CallKit display name override, Unicode handle fix, dual-UUID display name mirror, on-premise endpoint config)
- Upgrade OMICore Android SDK: `2.6.21` → `2.7.0` (also includes 2.6.22–2.6.27: incoming call full-screen, lazy native lib loading, ZCC display name update, duplicate CallSessionActivity dedup, RTP-dead watchdog, NetworkCallback leak fix, double-free / UAF guards, audio volume boost, ring popup auto-cancel, FCM `Infinity` crash guard)

## 4.1.7 [19/05/2026]

### Feature — Backend device registration check APIs (iOS 1.11.19 / Android 2.6.22)

**Files:** `ios/Library/OmikitPlugin.m`, `ios/Library/OmikitPlugin.swift`, `android/src/main/java/com/omikitplugin/OmikitPluginModule.kt`, `src/NativeOmikitPlugin.ts`, `src/omikit.tsx`, `src/types/index.d.ts`

- **[FEATURE] `getOmiDevices()`** — New public API that fetches the list of devices currently registered on the OMI backend for the active SIP user. Returns `Promise<OmiDeviceInfo[]>` with normalized camelCase shape per device: `deviceId`, `token`, `deviceType` (`"ios"` / `"android"`), `voipToken`, `appId`, `createdTime`, `projectId`, `sipNumber`. Returns empty array on logout, network failure, or parse error — never rejects. Use to verify the local device record was not lost on the backend (e.g. after reinstall or backend cleanup).
- **[FEATURE] `isCurrentDeviceRegistered()`** — Verifies whether the local `deviceId` + `appId` pair appears in `getOmiDevices()` payload. Returns `false` early when not logged in, avoiding unnecessary HTTP.
- **[FEATURE] `needsReLogin()`** — Convenience guard built on `isCurrentDeviceRegistered`. Returns `true` when a SIP user is set locally but no matching device exists on backend — i.e. the local session is stale and the user must logout + login again to re-register. Recommended call sites: app foreground, before critical operations.
- **[FEATURE] `findSipNumberByDeviceId(devices, deviceId)`** — Pure JS helper that returns the `sipNumber` for a given `deviceId` in the devices array (or `null` if not found). Useful for comparing the active SIP account against the local device entry.
- **[FEATURE] `logoutAndWait()`** — Callback-aware logout that resolves **only after** the SDK finishes the backend `devices/remove` HTTP call and clears local state. Eliminates race conditions when the next operation (e.g. `initCallWithUserPassword`) needs to issue `devices/add` immediately. iOS uses `OmiClient.logoutWithCompletion:`; Android uses `OmiClient.logout(onCompleted)` with the SDK's internal 5-second wait window.

### Feature — JS event emitter unified on `DeviceEventEmitter` (Old Arch + New Arch)

**Files:** `ios/Library/OmikitPlugin.swift`, `src/omikit.tsx`

**Root cause:** In React Native New Architecture / bridgeless mode, the codegen TurboModule wrapper does not forward `addListener` / `removeListeners` calls to the underlying `RCTEventEmitter` instance, so its internal `_listenerCount` stays at `0`. `super.sendEvent` then short-circuits with *"sending event with no listeners registered"* and silently drops every event reaching JS — breaking `onCallStateChanged`, `onMuted`, `onSpeaker`, `onHold`, `onCallQuality`, etc. The previous per-module `NativeEventEmitter(module)` JS-side wrapper also did not receive events that the native bridge routed through `RCTDeviceEventEmitter`.

**Fix (iOS):** `OmikitPlugin.swift` now overrides `addListener` / `removeListeners` / `sendEvent` with a 3-tier dispatch strategy:
1. **Tier 1** — `super.sendEvent` when JS listener count > 0 (uses RN-wired path for the active architecture; works on both Old & New Arch).
2. **Tier 2** — `bridge.enqueueJSCall("RCTDeviceEventEmitter", "emit", …)` for Old Arch / interop bridge fallback.
3. **Tier 3** — `callableJSModules.invokeModule(...)` for bridgeless / pure New Arch fallback.

A local `jsListenerCount` mirrors the listener state via overridden `addListener` / `removeListeners`, guaranteeing `startObserving` / `stopObserving` fire at the right boundaries even when the codegen wrapper does not forward to `super`.

**Fix (JS):** `omiEmitter` is now exported as the global `DeviceEventEmitter` on both platforms (iOS & Android, Old Arch & New Arch). This matches the native bridge's `RCTDeviceEventEmitter` dispatch — every event emitted natively is now observable in JS regardless of architecture.

### Improvement — `getDeviceId` / `getAppId` now match `getOmiDevices` payload (Android)

- **[CHANGE] Android `getDeviceId` / `getAppId`** now prefer the new SDK public APIs `OmiClient.getDeviceId()` / `OmiClient.getAppId()` (OmiSDK 2.6.21+) over `OmiClient.registrationInfo` cache. Guarantees the returned values match the `device_id` / `app_id` returned by `getOmiDevices()` so client code can match its own device entry without knowing the internal pattern (`Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID` / `context.packageName`). Falls back to `registrationInfo` → direct OS lookup on older SDKs.

### Bug Fix (iOS): toggleMute bypasses CallKit — lock screen / banner never updates

**Files:** `ios/CallProcess/CallManager.swift`, `ios/Library/OmikitPlugin.swift`

**Root cause:** `CallManager.toggleMute()` called `call.toggleMute()` directly on the `OMICall` object, bypassing `OMISIPLib.callManager.toggleMute(for:completion:)`. Audio-level mute worked (OMISIP conference bridge connected/disconnected correctly) but CallKit was never notified via `CXSetMutedCallAction` → lock screen mic icon and native call banner always showed mic active. `sendMuteStatus()` and `resolve()` were also called immediately after the direct call, before OMISIP had finished the operation — `call.muted` could be read before it was flipped.

**Fix:**
- `CallManager.toggleMute()` now calls `omiLib.callManager.toggleMute(for:completion:)` — routes through `CXSetMutedCallAction` → CallKit updates native UI → `performSetMutedCallAction:` → OMISIP → `OMICallMediaStateChangedNotification`.
- `OmikitPlugin.toggleMute` moves `resolve()` and `sendMuteStatus()` inside the completion block — `call.muted` is authoritative at that point.
- `toggleMute` resolve/reject params now declared `@escaping` to allow capture inside async completion block.

### Developer Workflow

- **[ADD] `scripts/sync-to-example.sh`** — Syncs `lib/`, `src/`, `ios/`, `android/`, `*.podspec` from the plugin root into `example/node_modules/omikit-plugin/`. Bridges the gap from yarn `file:..` protocol (which copies instead of symlinking) so plugin changes are reflected in the example app without a full `yarn install`.
- **[ADD] npm scripts** in root `package.json`: `yarn sync`, `yarn dev:ios`, `yarn dev:android`, `yarn dev:metro` — sync + run example app in one command.

### Notes

- No caching implemented in this version — each `getOmiDevices` / `isCurrentDeviceRegistered` / `needsReLogin` call performs a fresh HTTP request. Recommended usage: call once after login or on app foreground, not in tight loops.
- These APIs are read-only diagnostics: the SDK never auto-logouts or auto-cleans up backend records. Client apps must decide the recovery action (typically: show alert → `logoutAndWait()` → prompt user to login again).
- On iOS, SDK device-list API is synchronous (blocking HTTP) — bridge wraps in background `DispatchQueue` to keep the JS thread responsive. On Android, the SDK API is `suspend fun` already — bridge uses `Dispatchers.IO`.
- Native side returns snake_case keys on both iOS & Android for backward compatibility with existing internal pipelines; the JS layer normalizes to camelCase via `normalizeDevice()` before returning to client code.

### Dependencies

- Upgrade OmiKit iOS SDK: `1.11.18` → `1.11.19`
- Upgrade OMICore Android SDK: `2.6.20` → `2.6.21`

## 4.1.7-mute [04/05/2026] _(superseded — merged into 4.1.7 above)_

### Bug Fix (iOS): toggleMute bypasses CallKit — lock screen / banner never updates

**Files:** `ios/CallProcess/CallManager.swift`, `ios/Library/OmikitPlugin.swift`

**Root cause:** `CallManager.toggleMute()` called `call.toggleMute()` directly on the `OMICall` object, bypassing `OMISIPLib.callManager.toggleMute(for:completion:)`. Audio-level mute worked (OMISIP conference bridge connected/disconnected correctly) but CallKit was never notified via `CXSetMutedCallAction` → lock screen mic icon and native call banner always showed mic active. `sendMuteStatus()` and `resolve()` were also called immediately after the direct call, before OMISIP had finished the operation — `call.muted` could be read before it was flipped.

**Fix:**
- `CallManager.toggleMute()` now calls `omiLib.callManager.toggleMute(for:completion:)` — routes through `CXSetMutedCallAction` → CallKit updates native UI → `performSetMutedCallAction:` → OMISIP → `OMICallMediaStateChangedNotification`.
- `OmikitPlugin.toggleMute` moves `resolve()` and `sendMuteStatus()` inside the completion block — `call.muted` is authoritative at that point.

## 4.1.6 [14/04/2026]

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix Android Kotlin 2.0 compile error (all versions)** — refactored `getCurrentUser`, `getGuestUser`, `getUserInfo` to use `val` return from `withContext` + shared `resolveUserResult()` helper, eliminating `if`-as-expression issue compatible with all Kotlin versions

## 4.1.5 [14/04/2026]

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix iOS `codeEndCall` intermittently missing** — `callDealloc` now extracts `OMINotificationEndCauseKey` from the `OMICallDealloc` notification (matching native app behavior) instead of relying on `call.lastStatus` which may not be set at disconnect time
- **Fix iOS `tempCallInfo` cleared too early** — `callStateChanged` no longer resets `tempCallInfo` after disconnect event; `callDealloc` retains and clears it after use, ensuring `codeEndCall` is always available regardless of notification order

## 4.1.4 [14/04/2026]

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix Android build error on Kotlin 2.0+** — `if` without `else` in `withContext` block caused `'if' must have both main and 'else' branches if used as an expression` compile error in `getCurrentUser`

### Dependencies
- Upgrade OMICore Android SDK: 2.6.8 → 2.6.9


## 4.1.3 [13/04/2026]

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix `getCurrentUser` returning `null`/`undefined`** — added debug logging on both iOS and Android to diagnose timing issues where `getCurrentUser` is called before SIP registration completes
- **Fix iOS `getCurrentUser` returning empty object `{}`** — now returns `nil` instead of `[:]` when user not found, so JS receives `undefined` instead of misleading empty object


## 4.1.2 [07/04/2026]

### New Architecture (React Native 0.76+)
- **Fix "supports new architecture: false" warning** — podspec now uses `install_modules_dependencies` (RN 0.71+ standard) instead of manual `ENV['RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED']` check
- **iOS TurboModule declaration** — `OmikitPlugin` conforms to codegen-generated `NativeOmikitPluginSpec` protocol when `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1` via Swift extension
- **Android TurboReactPackage** — migrated `OmikitPluginPackage` from `ReactPackage` to `TurboReactPackage` with lazy module loading via `getModule()` + `getReactModuleInfoProvider()`
- Fully compatible with Old Architecture, New Architecture (interop layer), and bridgeless mode

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix `ClassCastException` on Android (Old Architecture)** — `getInitialCall` was declared as `fun getInitialCall(counter: Int, promise)` but JS passes `{ counter: N }` as a `ReadableMap`; refactored to accept `ReadableMap` and extract `counter` correctly
- **Fix ViewManager instance sharing** — `OmiLocalCameraView` / `OmiRemoteCameraView` are now guaranteed to be the same instance when registered as both NativeModule and ViewManager (prevents `NativeModules.OmiLocalCameraView.refresh()` from affecting a different object than the rendered view)

### Documentation
- Document `tools:node="remove"` for `WRITE_CALL_LOG` permission — users who do not want calls saved to device call history can opt out via `AndroidManifest.xml`

### TurboModule Spec
- Add missing iOS-only methods to `NativeOmikitPlugin.ts` spec: `setCameraConfig`, `setupVideoContainers`, `attachRemoteView`, `attachLocalView`
- Add missing exports to `omikit.tsx`: `getKeepAliveStatus`, `triggerKeepAlivePing`

### Dependencies
- Upgrade OMICore Android SDK: 2.6.5 → 2.6.8
- Upgrade OmiKit iOS SDK: 1.11.4 → 1.11.9

## 4.1.1 [26/03/2026]

### Video Call Optimization
- **Fix video delay 9-10 seconds** (Android → iOS/Web) — real-time video, HD quality
- **Fix switch camera failure** (`PJ_EINVAL` error)
- **Android video auto-scale** — remote video fills screen with correct aspect ratio for app-to-app and app-to-web calls
- **Android video borderRadius** — `OmiLocalCameraView` / `OmiRemoteCameraView` now respect `borderRadius`, `overflow: 'hidden'` from React style props via native `ViewOutlineProvider` + `clipToOutline`

### Expo / RN 0.81+ Compatibility
- **Fix `Unresolved reference: currentActivity`** on Expo 54+ / RN 0.81 bridgeless mode — replaced all direct `currentActivity` access (15+ call sites) with `safeActivity` helper that uses `reactApplicationContext?.currentActivity`
- **Fix `Unresolved reference: runOnUiThread`** — same root cause, `runOnUiThread` accessed via `safeActivity?.runOnUiThread`
- Fully compatible with Old Architecture (bridge), New Architecture (bridgeless), and Expo managed workflow

### iOS Video Call (Fabric / New Architecture)
- **Native window video rendering** for Fabric mode — video containers added to key window with `isUserInteractionEnabled = false` (touch passthrough)
- **Split layout**: remote video top, React controls bottom (Fabric limitation — legacy ViewManager `view()` not called in Fabric)
- **`setupVideoContainers()`** — native method to initialize video when call confirmed
- **`cleanupVideoContainers()`** — native method to remove video views on disconnect
- **`setCameraConfig()`** — native method to adjust remote/local camera position, size, borderRadius, borderColor, scaleMode from JS
- Old Architecture: `<OmiRemoteCameraView>` / `<OmiLocalCameraView>` in JSX works as before

### Example App Updates
- **Video call screen** — full rewrite with proper call state management, mute/speaker/camera toggle, switch camera, call timer, end call navigation
- **Dial call screen** — audio call with hold, transfer, DTMF support
- **Incoming call routing** — auto-detect audio vs video call, navigate to correct screen
- **Disconnect handling** — `cleanupVideoContainers()` on iOS before navigation to prevent ghost video layer

### TypeScript Definitions
- Add missing exports: `OmiLocalCameraView`, `OmiRemoteCameraView`, `setupVideoContainers`, `cleanupVideoContainers`, `setCameraConfig`
- Add `OmiCallState.disconnecting = 12`
- Update all function signatures with proper return types

### Dependencies
- Upgrade OMICore Android SDK: 2.6.4 → 2.6.5
- Upgrade OmiKit iOS SDK: 1.11.2 → 1.11.4

### CI/CD
- Fix `@types/react-native` resolution error — remove deprecated package (built-in since RN 0.76)
- Regenerate `yarn.lock` without stale entries


## 4.1.0 [19/03/2026]

### Video Call — Major Rewrite (iOS + Android)

**Architecture change (iOS)**: Migrated from `OMIVideoViewManager` (manual Metal view management) to `OMIVideoCallManager` (SDK-managed lifecycle).

- **Stable video rendering** — SDK manages Metal drawable pool, frame watchdog, and error recovery automatically
- **Background/foreground recovery** — video resumes automatically when app returns from background
- **Loading indicator** — SDK shows loading overlay while waiting for video frames
- **Camera switch guard** — prevents race conditions during front/back camera switch

**Android rename & unification**: Renamed all `FL*` prefixed video classes to `Omi*` to match iOS naming convention.

- **Unified naming** — Both platforms now use `OmiLocalCameraView` / `OmiRemoteCameraView`
- **Merged ViewManager + Module** — `refresh()` method now lives directly in ViewManager (matches iOS pattern), eliminating separate `*Module` classes
- **Fixed native module registration** — `getName()` now returns `"OmiLocalCameraView"` / `"OmiRemoteCameraView"` matching JS `requireNativeComponent()` and `NativeModules.*` expectations
- **Thread-safe refresh** — `refresh()` now dispatches to UI thread via `UiThreadUtil.runOnUiThread`

### File Changes (Internal Only — JS API Unchanged)

**iOS:**
| Old (internal) | New (internal) |
|---|---|
| `FLLocalCameraView.swift` / `.m` | `OmiLocalCameraViewManager.swift` / `OmiLocalCameraViewBridge.m` |
| `FLRemoteCameraView.swift` / `.m` | `OmiRemoteCameraViewManager.swift` / `OmiRemoteCameraViewBridge.m` |

**Android:**
| Old (4 files) | New (2 files) |
|---|---|
| `FLLocalCameraView.kt` + `FLLocalCameraModule.kt` | `OmiLocalCameraView.kt` (merged) |
| `FLRemoteCameraView.kt` + `FLRemoteCameraModule.kt` | `OmiRemoteCameraView.kt` (merged) |

### Improvements

- Removed dependency on `OMIVideoViewManager` (deprecated old API)
- Reduced view hierarchy: 2 views instead of 4 (iOS), 2 classes instead of 4 (Android)
- Async video setup — no longer blocks JS thread during call connection
- Camera views accept standard RN `style` props (borderRadius, borderWidth, etc.)
- BG→FG observer in `CallManager` calls `prepareForVideoDisplay()` automatically (iOS)
- Consistent `Omi` prefix across both platforms

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed video freeze when switching camera during active call (iOS)
- Fixed memory leak from unreleased Metal views on call disconnect (iOS)
- Fixed blank remote video on incoming call from background (iOS)
- **Fixed Android video views not rendering** — `getName()` mismatch (`FL*` vs `Omi*`) caused `requireNativeComponent` and `NativeModules` to fail silently
- **Fixed Android `refresh()` crash risk** — view layout ops now run on UI thread

### Dependencies

- OmiKit iOS SDK: 1.10.34 → 1.11.2
- OmiSIP framework: Updated with CADisplayLink Metal renderer

## 4.0.2 [17/03/2026]

### Bug Fixes — Android Native
- Fix build failure on RN 0.80+ / Kotlin 2.x / Gradle 8.14+ — removed `buildscript` block and `kotlin-bom:1.8.0` from library `build.gradle`
- Fix `currentActivity!!` NPE crash in `checkAndRequestPermissions`, `requestPermissionsByCodes`, `requestPermission` — replaced with null safety
- Fix `getBoolean()` crash when optional params omitted — added `hasKey()` guard (8 call sites)
- Fix `checkPermissionStatus` crash from `Arguments.makeNativeMap` with nested collections — use `WritableNativeMap`
- Fix `systemAlertWindow` / `openSystemAlertSetting` crash on pre-Marshmallow — added runtime API level guard
- Migrate deprecated `lintOptions` → `lint`, `dataBinding` syntax for AGP 8+

### Bug Fixes — JS
- Fix `omiEmitter` undefined crash in New Architecture bridgeless mode — safe module resolution with try-catch fallback chain
- Fix `requireNativeComponent` crash at import time in bridgeless mode — camera views (`OmiLocalCameraView`, `OmiRemoteCameraView`) now use lazy loading via Proxy
- Fix FCM token fetch failure blocking login — wrapped in try-catch with empty string fallback

### New Architecture Support
- `omikit.tsx`: TurboModule → NativeModules → fallback resolution, safe for bridge + bridgeless mode
- `omiEmitter`: `NativeEventEmitter(module)` → `NativeEventEmitter()` → `DeviceEventEmitter` fallback
- Tested on RN 0.80.3 (Kotlin 2.1.20, Gradle 8.14.1) — both Old and New Architecture

### Documentation
- Add API Integration Guide for App-to-App service (`docs/api-integration-guide.md`)
- README: Add App-to-App API section, `startServices()` usage note, VoIP/FCM setup link, Logout API warning
- Add CHANGELOG for v4.0.2

### Build & CI
- Add GitHub Actions workflow for Android build validation on `main-v2`
- Update `gradle.properties` defaults: compileSdk 33→35, Kotlin 1.8.20→2.0.21 (fallback only)

## 4.0.1 [09/03/2026]

### New Features
- Add getter functions: `getProjectId`, `getAppId`, `getDeviceId`, `getFcmToken`, `getSipInfo`, `getVoipToken` (iOS only)
- New Architecture support: TurboModule codegen spec with runtime auto-detection
- `getConstants()` method for exporting event constants to JavaScript
- Add `isSkipDevices` parameter to `initCallWithUserPassword` — set `true` for Customer mode (hotline only), `false` for Agent mode (full outbound)
- Full Quality & Diagnostics: `onCallQuality` event now returns `{ quality, stat: { mos, jitter, latency, packetLoss, lcn } }`
- Add `noNetwork` (11) and `accountTurnOffNumberInternal` (10) to `OmiStartCallStatus` enum

### Bug Fixes
- Fix iOS `getUserInfo` selector mismatch (typo `getUserInfor`)
- Fix NativeEventEmitter crash on iOS New Architecture
- Fix Android name collision between FLLocalCameraModule and FLLocalCameraView
- Fix null guard for `refreshLocalCamera` / `refreshRemoteCamera` on iOS
- Fix Android `networkHealth` only passing `quality` int — now passes full stat map (mos, jitter, latency, packetLoss, lcn)
- Fix iOS `updateNetworkHealth` only passing `quality` int — now passes full stat data (mos, jitter, latency, packetLoss)

### Improvements
- Runtime architecture detection - automatically uses TurboModule or NativeModule
- Enhanced TypeScript definitions with proper return types
- Codegen configuration in `package.json` for automatic native code generation
- iOS TurboModule conformance and constants export
- Android `getConstants()` for event name constants
- Comprehensive README rewrite with API reference, call flow diagrams, end-call status codes, and Quality & Diagnostics documentation

### Security
